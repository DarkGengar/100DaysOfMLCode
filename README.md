# 100 Days Of ML Code - Log

## Day 1 : September 23, 2018

**Today's Progress:**: Begin with the journey and watch lecture 1 Introduction to 
RL of David Silver's RL course

**Thoughts:** I am very excited.

## Day 2: September 24, 2018

**Today's Progress:**: Start with chapter 3 Monte Carlo Methods of the course Move 37,
finished lecture 3.1 and 3.2 of the course and start with lecture 4 Model-Free Prediction 
of David Silver's RL course.

**Thoughts:** I learned methods to work with unknown MDPs.

## Day 3: September 25, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I have finished lecture 3.5 of the course Move 37 and continue watching
lecture 4 of David Silver's RL course.

**Thoughts:** I have understand the concepts of first-visit MC policy evaluation and
every-visit MC policy evaluation however I am a bit confused where the function
gets the reward values for the mean return when the reward and transition 
function is unknown.

## Day 4: September 26, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I have started lecture 3.3 of the course Move 37 and read
chapter 5 Monte Carlo Methods of Sutton's RL book.

**Thoughts:** I have a lot of questions I want to answer
during this week and I hope I can find the answers.

## Day 5: September 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continue reading lecture 3.3 of the course Move 37.

**Thoughts**: The Multi Armed Bandits methods seems to be useful for RL and I am
interested to see how well it works for RL.

## Day 6: September 28, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I have watched the livestream TPU Machine Learning by Siraj Raval
and read more about Exploration and Exploitation methods.
